# Breakout
For this project I built the game breakout entirely in ARM Assembly Language.
Breakout was originally developed by Steve Wozniak in 1976 and was one of the most popular Atari games in the world.

This game was developed entirely in ARM assembly language and runs on a Tivia C EK-TM4C123GXL microcontroller.
It takes input from the user as keyboard button presses, button presses on the Tivia C board, and button presses on a connected Daughter Board.
It simulates the game and renders the game in the terminal by printing characters and using ANSI Escape Sequences.
