This video shows a few things.
  1. Random colors generated for brick colors.
  2. Ball changes color based on bricks hit.
  3. Score increasing with each brick hit.
  4. Life count decreasing with letting ball fall below paddle.
  5. Increased score per brick hit for higher levels.  Also ball speed Increases for higher levels.
  6. Pause and unpausing the game is implmented.

For this video I only generated 1 row of bricks because it makes beating the levels much faster.  The user can control how many rows of bricks are generated by pressing a button on the Daughter Board.
